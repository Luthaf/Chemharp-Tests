# Chemfiles data files for integration tests

This repository contains data files for testing the
[chemfiles](https://github.com/chemfiles/tests-data) library.

Each folder contains files in a given format, and contains either files that should be
readable, or files that should fail. The failing files are put together into a `bad`
folder.

All these files are under the CC-0 licence.
