# Chemharp Test Cases

Test cases for the Chemharp chemistry IO library. These test files are separated
from the main repository because they might be very big.

## Organisation

Each folder is a format, and contains either files that should be readable, or
files that should fail. The failing files are put together into a `bad` folder.

## Licence

All these files are under the CC-0 licence.
